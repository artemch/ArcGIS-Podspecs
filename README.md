ArcGIS-Podspecs
===============
The ArcGIS-Podspecs project provides a local podspec for each version of the Esri Runtime SDK for iOS going back to 2.3.2. These enable you to manage your Esri iOS SDK dependency like any other CocoaPod.

You will need to download and install the SDK directly from Esri, as I am not authorized to distribute it here.

The current and previous versions of the Esri iOS SDK can be found [here](http://www.esri.com/apps/products/download/index.cfm?fuseaction=download.all#ArcGIS_Runtime_SDK_for_iOS). An Esri Global Account may be required to download.
