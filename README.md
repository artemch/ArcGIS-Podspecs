ArcGIS-Podspecs
===============
The ArcGIS-Podspecs project provides a local podspec for each version of the Esri Runtime SDK for iOS going back to 2.3.2. These enable you to manage your Esri iOS SDK dependency like any other CocoaPod.

You will need to download and install the SDK directly from Esri, as I am not authorized to distribute it.

The current and previous versions of the Esri iOS SDK can be found [here](http://www.esri.com/apps/products/download/index.cfm?fuseaction=download.all#ArcGIS_Runtime_SDK_for_iOS). An Esri Global Account may be required to download.

For additional information on the CocoaPods project, please see [CocoaPods.org](http://cocoapods.org).

### How To Get This All Setup
______

# 1. Create a directory at /Users/Shared/Library/ArcGIS

# 2. Download the master zip or clone this repo into that directory. 

This will create a subdirectory for each version of the Esri iOS SDK. At current writing, these are 2.3.2, 10.1.1, and 10.1.1-u1. Each directory will contain an ArcGIS.podspec file that points to an (as of yet non-existent) zip file in the same directory.

# 3. Download and install the latest version of the Esri iOS SDK.
